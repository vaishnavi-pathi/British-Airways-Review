## Problem Statement

This dashboard is designed to provide British Airways with a comprehensive overview of customer satisfaction across various aspects of their in-flight experience. The airline industry faces intense competition, with customer satisfaction being a critical differentiator. This dashboard enables British Airways to understand customer feedback, identify areas of dissatisfaction, and proactively address them. By analyzing different rating metrics, the dashboard highlights both strengths and improvement areas, allowing British Airways to make data-driven decisions that enhance service quality, retain customers, and improve overall customer experience.



### Primary Goals

Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Identify areas where customers are less satisfied and implement changes to improve these aspects.

Operational Improvements: Pinpoint specific aircraft or regions with lower ratings to target operational improvements or tailored services.

Strategic Decisions: Use customer feedback data to guide decisions related to service updates, investment in in-flight entertainment, and food service improvements.


## Insights

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard:

### [1] Overall Ratings:

Average Rating: 4.2 out of 5, indicating generally positive customer satisfaction. 

Cabin Staff Service: 3.3 out of 5, suggesting that improvements could be made in staff service to enhance the customer experience.

Entertainment: Low average rating of 1.4, highlighting it as an area where British Airways may need to invest in better options.

Food and Beverages: 2.4 out of 5, indicating room for improvement in in-flight dining options.

Ground Service: 3.0 out of 5, showing moderate satisfaction but potential for enhancement.

           
### [2] Rating by Aircraft Type:

The Boeing 747-400 has the highest average rating of 4.7, with a moderate number of reviews (97), suggesting high satisfaction on this aircraft model.

Other models like the Boeing 787 and Boeing 777 have average ratings around 4.4, indicating consistent performance across these models.

Aircraft with lower average ratings (e.g., A319 with 3.8 and A321 with 3.6) may need additional improvements in terms of seating comfort or in-flight amenities.

 ### Review Volume by Aircraft:
 
Aircraft such as the Boeing 777 (263 reviews) and Various Aircrafts (Below 50 reviews) (329 reviews) have the highest number of reviews. This could be due to higher utilization or longer routes, giving more passengers an opportunity to review. British Airways could focus on maintaining or improving service quality in these frequently reviewed aircrafts.
         
## Areas for Improvement:

Entertainment and Food: Both metrics have notably low scores, indicating significant customer dissatisfaction. British Airways may benefit from enhancing its entertainment options and food quality to improve overall passenger experience.

Cabin Staff Service: Improving cabin staff interactions could also boost customer satisfaction, as staff service is directly linked to passenger comfort and experience.
